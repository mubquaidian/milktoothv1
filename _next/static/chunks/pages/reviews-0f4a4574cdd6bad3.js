I already have a second tester order lined up & ready to go as soon as I get confirmation you got my first one back. I‘m someone who has to feel things for themselves instead of trusting the internet for what’s “thock” / “clack” / “scratchy” / “marbly” / [insert whatever other adjectives switch reviewers use] so I seriously appreciate the opportunity to feel all these switches for myself and determine what I like.

I really do like the 3D printed trays they come in, as I don't have a [compatible] keyboard yet so it gives a better indication of the feel of the switch as well as the sound.
