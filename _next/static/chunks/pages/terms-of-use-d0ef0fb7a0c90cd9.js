Milktooth, which does business with the same name (Milktooth), operates and provides online services and programs through milktooth.nu (the “Site”). We’ll go by “Milktooth”, “we”, or “us” to keep it simple. We know these types of documents can get pretty dense, but we want you to read this, so we’ll do our best to keep it easy to read. We will also refer to the Site, and any of our services and offerings available through them as the “Services.”","Before using any of the Services, please read these Terms of Use (these “Terms”) and any other policies and notices on the Site or as otherwise made available to you by Us. Collectively, these materials contain terms, rules, and other guidelines related to your use of the Services. As a condition to your access to or use of the Services, you consent to be bound by these Terms, so please do not use the Services if you do not agree with all of these Terms. Some parts of the Services may have other terms, guidelines, or rules, and if you use those parts, those additional terms will also apply. Your use of the Services, and our provision of the Services to you, constitutes an agreement between you and Milktooth to be bound by each of the terms, guidelines, and rules incorporated into these Terms. Because these Terms are legally binding, we want to make sure you understand them (like really understand them), so if you have any questions, contact Us by following the instructions at https://milktooth.nu/contact.","THESE TERMS PROVIDE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND MILKTOOTH RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, AND YOUR CLAIMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ACTION. PLEASE REVIEW SECTION 18 (“DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION”) FOR THE DETAILS REGARDING YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTES WITH MILKTOOTH.","1. We Reserve the Right to Update and Revise These Terms of Use at Any Time","Things happen quickly, both inside and outside of Milktooth, so We will sometimes review these Terms to make sure they accurately reflect developments in current law and our business operations. We reserve the right to update and revise these Terms at any time upon seven days’ notice. We’ll provide notice by by reasonable means, including by posting the updated Terms and by changing the “Effective Date” at the top of this page so you can tell if these Terms have changed since your last visit. Please review these Terms regularly because seven days after we post any changes, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.","2. Eligibility","The Site is a general audience site available to users who can form legally binding agreements under applicable law and is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. Only individuals who are at least 18 years old and can form legally binding contracts may use the Services. However, even non-adults deserve fantastic switches. You can use the Services if you are under 18, but only if you are at least 13 years old and only if a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years old supervises you. In all cases, the adult will be the user and is responsible for any and all activity. If you are younger than 13 years old, you may not use the Services (although your parents or legal guardian can still buy switches for you).","Your use of the Services means you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements We outline in these Terms. However, We may refuse to let certain people access or use the Services. We may also change our eligibility criteria.","We offer the Services only for personal, noncommercial use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party (unless you are a parent or legal guardian using the Services for your minor child).","The Site  and Services available through them are intended for use within the United States. Access to the Site and Services may therefore not be appropriate or available in certain countries outside the United States. If you access the Site or App or any Services from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for complying with the laws and regulations of your territory of access.","3. The Try At-Home Program","Milktooth offers a five-day try at-home program to help you pick your perfect switches. You may choose ten sets of switches (which are sent on switch tester bases with keycaps) to try at home for a five-day period (the “Try At-Home Period”). If the Try At-Home Period ends and any of the switches (along with the switch tester bases with keycaps) have not been placed in the mail, or the switches (or switch tester bases and keycaps) are returned damaged, We may charge your credit card for the full amount of switches, switch tester bases, and keycaps that are missing or damaged. By submitting your try at-home order, you authorize Milktooth to charge your card, and you agree to all other terms of our try at-home program. Currently, our try at-home program is only available to customers who live in the 50 United States.","The try at-home program currently costs $10.","If you do not return your Try At-Home box, or if returned switches, switch tester bases, and/or keycaps are damaged, we will need to charge the card on file the full price for each outstanding or damaged part, $10-20 depending on part. In order to avoid this charge, your Try At-Home box will need to be postmarked—it’s on its way back to Milktooth—by the fifth full day after delivery. (We’ll send you an email reminder so you don’t forget.) If your Try At-Home period ends on a weekend or holiday, just drop it in the mail on the next available day. If you need an extra day or two, contact us and we’ll work something out."]};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"Terms of use"}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"overflow-hidden bg-white",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative mx-auto max-w-7xl py-12",children:[(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-prose text-base lg:grid lg:max-w-none lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-8",children:(0,a.jsx)("div",{children:(0,a.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-5xl lg:text-6xl",children:"Terms of use"})})}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mt-8",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-8 lg:mt-0",children:[(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-prose text-base lg:max-w-none",children:(0,a.jsx)("p",{className:"text-lg text-gray-500",children:e.firstLine})}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"mx-auto mt-5 grid max-w-prose gap-4 leading-relaxed lg:col-start-1 lg:row-start-1 lg:max-w-none",children:e.paragraphs.map(e=>(0,a.jsx)("p",{children:e},e))})]})})]})})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],function(){return e(e.s=6851)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
