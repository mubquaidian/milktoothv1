These switches are ingeniously designed for a cleaner, refined sound profile. When typing on them, we detect the deep, resonant \"thock\" of the U4T when bottoming out, coupled with the whisper-quiet stealth of the U4 when topping out. Each press will provide a sharp, satisfying tactile bump, ensuring a luxurious typing experience that's as acoustically pleasing as it is tactile.","brand_id":16,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/milktooth/image/upload/v1690333384/products/switches/Gazzew_U4Tx_fu7coz.png","actuation_grams":null,"bottom_out_grams":65,"number_of_switches":10,"youtube":null,"created_at":"2023-07-26T00:56:18+00:00","silent":null,"technical_data_id":210,"color_light":null,"color_accent":null,"color_switch":"#f6f8fa","page_order":2,"draft":null,"stripe_price_id":"price_1NXvyPAdvdKnTEXLQgT5IRST","tah_stripe_price_id":"price_1NXvyPAdvdKnTEXLibTD1YJk","out_of_stock":false,"repriced_stripe_price_id":"price_1NXvyPAdvdKnTEXLQgT5IRST","price":650,"switches_type":{"type":"Tactile","slug":"tactile-switches"},"switches_brand":{"brand":"Gazzew","slug":"gazzew"},"switches_technical_data":{"id":210,"created_at":"2023-07-26T01:38:16.291179+00:00","stem_material":"POM","spring":"Stainless
