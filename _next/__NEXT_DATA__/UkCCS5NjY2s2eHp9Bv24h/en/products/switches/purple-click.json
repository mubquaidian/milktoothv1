Therefore, due to its translucency, polycarbonate is especially useful to have in the top housing of a switch if you plan to use RGB lighting.","created_at":"2023-02-11T05:37:06.119032+00:00"},"bottom_housing":{"id":2,"housing_material":"Nylon","description":"Nylon is a classic switch housing material.
