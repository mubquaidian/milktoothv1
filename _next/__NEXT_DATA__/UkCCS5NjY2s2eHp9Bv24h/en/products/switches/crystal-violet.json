Ideal for those seeking a relaxed and stepped tactile typing experience, these switches offer a gentle and comfortable feel. The sound profile of the Crystal Violet switches is pleasantly mellow, leaning towards the lower-pitched spectrum, creating a subtle and non-intrusive auditory experience; in part, this is due to the rare and special use of ABS in these switches' housings.","brand_id":6,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/milktooth/image/upload/v1689392923/products/switches/Everglide_Crystal_Violet_jnygee.png","actuation_grams":45,"bottom_out_grams":55,"number_of_switches":10,"youtube":null,"created_at":"2023-07-16T23:52:06+00:00","silent":null,"technical_data_id":205,"color_light":null,"color_accent":null,"color_switch":"#d9d2e9","page_order":null,"draft":null,"stripe_price_id":"price_1NUfapAdvdKnTEXLSIlL6Qlk","tah_stripe_price_id":"price_1NUfapAdvdKnTEXLYEZZ06ww","out_of_stock":false,"repriced_stripe_price_id":"price_1NUfapAdvdKnTEXLSIlL6Qlk","price":419,"switches_type":{"type":"Tactile","slug":"tactile-switches"},"switches_brand":{"brand":"Everglide","slug":"everglide"},"switches_technical_data":{"id":205,"created_at":"2023-07-17T00:13:25.005871+00:00","stem_material":"POM","spring":"Gold-plated","stem":1,"top_housing":10,"bottom_housing":10,"mount_type":1,"pre_travel":2,"total_travel":4,"factory_lubed":true,"force_graph_link":null},"switches_reviews":[]},"switchesBySameType":[{"id":"meteor-orange","name":"Meteor
