{"pageProps":{"switchData":{"id":"ws-silent-tactile","name":"WS Silent Tactile","type_id":3,"desc":"Introducing the exceptional WS Silent Tactile switches by Wuque, a perfect companion for your office and work environment. These switches strike a delicate balance, offering a medium level of tactility without compromising on noise reduction. Crafted with precision, the WS Silent Tactile switches feature ingenious stem railings with small cutouts, effectively minimizing switch sound while delivering a satisfyingly crisp bottom-out and responsive return, all while maintaining an impressively silent profile. Distinguished from conventional silent switches, these unique tactile switches forgo the use of silicone dampeners, ensuring a typing experience that is devoid of the usual padded feel found in most silent switches, creating an unrivaled blend of tranquility and tactility.","brand_id":13,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/milktooth/image/upload/v1688352462/products/switches/WS_Silent_Tactile_nqanvl.png","actuation_grams":null,"bottom_out_grams":63.5,"number_of_switches":10,"youtube":null,"created_at":"2023-07-04T03:52:37+00:00","silent":true,"technical_data_id":191,"color_light":null,"color_accent":null,"color_switch":"#8a8894","page_order":15,"draft":false,"stripe_price_id":"price_1NQ3heAdvdKnTEXLneBaQxE1","tah_stripe_price_id":"price_1NQ3heAdvdKnTEXLD8S9VfUA","out_of_stock":false,"repriced_stripe_price_id":"price_1NQ3heAdvdKnTEXLneBaQxE1","price":365,"switches_type":{"type":"Tactile","slug":"tactile-switches"},"switches_brand":{"brand":"Wuque
