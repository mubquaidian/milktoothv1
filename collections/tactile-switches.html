           Tactile switches are good for many use cases: they are an excellent all-rounder. Tactile switches are good for gaming because of the the tactile bump you feel when pressing down. Tactile switches can be good for office work and noise-sensitive environments because they are relatively quiet. Other users like it for its tactility and clacky or thocky sound profile.
